## What is done?

1. Read bvh motion and play it in Unity. Recommend bvh file from [this link](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset).
2. Motion retargeting from .bvh file to a charactor in Unity, from [this Unity tutorial](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-learn-3d-beginner-tutorial-resources-urp-143848).
